# Notes from the book:
#
#   * Read: return empty string when it reaches the end of the file,
#     and hows up as a blank line
#
#   * rstrip(): removes, or strips, any whitespace 
#     characters from the right side of a string
#
#   * When a relative path is too long, it's helpful
#     to store it in a varible, For Example:
#     =>    file_path = '/home/ehmatthes/other_files/text_files/filename.txt'   "In linux"
#     =>    file_path = 'C:\Users\ehmatthes\other_files\text_files\filename.txt'    "In Windows"
#
#   * Why you may need to read a file line by line:
#       => you might want to modify the text in the file in some way.
#          For example: you wont to modify any line that contain a specific word,
#                       and rewrite that line with a specific kind of formatting.
#                       see ""Read line by line Chapter""
#
#   * Why you may need to store the contant of the file in the variable:
#       => When you use with statmen, the file object returned by open() is only available inside 
#          the with block that contains it, so you can store the file line's in a list inside the block
#          to process parts of the file immediately and postpone some processing for later in the program
#          outside the with statment. For Example see ""Making a List of Lines from a File Chapter""
